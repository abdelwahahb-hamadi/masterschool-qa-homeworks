Age Verification for Alcoholic Products

Requirement:Alcoholic products require age verification. A modal should appear when navigating to the alcoholic products category asking if the user is 18+. Users must input their age before accessing the alcoholic products.

Questions:
1. Does the age verification modal appear only when entering the Alcohol category, or also when searching for alcoholic products?
2. Should users enter their date of birth, or is a simple “Yes, I’m 18+” confirmation enough?
3. If the user is under 18, should they be blocked from viewing the page entirely or just from purchasing?
4. Is the age verification stored for the current session (so the user isn’t asked again)?
5. Will there be a second age check during checkout if the cart includes alcoholic products?
