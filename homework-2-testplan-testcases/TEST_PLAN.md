TEST PLAN – Market Mate Webshop

Analyze the Product
Market Mate is an online grocery webshop that allows users to register, log in, search for products, add products to favorites or basket, and complete checkout.
The new features include:
	•	Product Rating System

Focus will be on:
	•	User interface behavior
	•	Input validation
	•	Business logic consistency

Define Test Objectives
	•	Verify users can rate products using the 5-star system.
	•	Ensure users under 18 cannot access or purchase alcoholic products.
